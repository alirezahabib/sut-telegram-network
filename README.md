# Telegram Group Network Analysis

![result](plots/network2.jpg)

## Overview

We studied the communication network among members of the course within the Telegram group. Using Telegramâ€™s MTProto API and `telethon` library, we collected data on users and message interactions. The gathered data was saved in a database for further analysis. We analyzed the degree distribution of individuals interacting, revealing power-law behavior akin to real social networks. 
The network was constructed in `networkx` based on interactions such as replies, reactions, and pinned messages.

## Features

- Utilizes Telegram's MTProto API and Telethon library for data collection.
- Captures and stores user profiles and various message interactions in a database.
- Analyzes the degree distribution of participants engaging in interactions, revealing power-law behavior akin to real social networks.
- Constructs a network framework incorporating interactions such as replies, reactions, and pinned messages, offering insights into network dynamics and participant engagement patterns.
