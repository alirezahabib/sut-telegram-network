# Telegram Group Network Analysis

![result](plots/network2.jpg)

## Overview

We studied the communication network among members of the course within the Telegram group. Using Telegramâ€™s MTProto API and telethon library, we collected data on users and message interactions. The gathered data was saved in a database for further analysis. We analyzed the degree distribution of individuals interacting, revealing power-law behavior akin to real social networks. 
The network was constructed based on interactions such as replies, reactions, and pinned messages.
